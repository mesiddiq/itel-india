      "For some models, you can just keep pressing the music for seconds, and the secondary menu will pop up automatically. You can choose “set it as ringtone”",
        "For other models, you need to find the “Ringtone” folder in your document management (file manager). Put your music in the “Ringtone” folder first, then you can go to Settings > Sounds to set it as your ringtone."

    {
      problem:"Cannot make a call after activating data",
      solution:[
        1. IF or not all the contacts cannot be called. If yes, go to step 2\. If not, maybe it's not a phone issue.
        2. Make sure the SIM account has enough balance and the place has a good signal.
        3. Check whether the phone is on 4G only mode, if yes, change to other modes.
        4. Try to reset factory settings, but remember to take data back up first.
        5. Visit the nearest customer service center for further check.
