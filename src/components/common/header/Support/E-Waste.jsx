    E-waste is a popular, informal name for electronic waste products nearing the end of their “useful life.” Telephones, pay phones, cordless phones, air conditioners, televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, mobile phones, computers, VCDs, stereos, copiers, and fax machines are common electronic products. Many of these products can be reused, refurbished, or recycled.

E-waste has been one of the fastest-growing waste streams in the world. While e-waste contains valuable materials such as aluminium, copper, gold, palladium, and silver, it also contains harmful substances like cadmium, lead, and mercury. In the absence of proper awareness, disposing of e-waste in landfills can result in toxic emissions to the air, water, and soil and pose serious health and environmental hazards.
